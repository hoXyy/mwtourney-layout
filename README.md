# mwtourney-layout
NodeCG layouts used during GTA Speedrunning Community's 2020 GTA IV Most Wanted Tournament

*This is a bundle for NodeCG; if you do not understand what that is, I advise you read their website first for more information.*

# Installation

You will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (10.x LTS tested) and git installed to install NodeCG, then see the [NodeCG documentation](https://www.nodecg.dev/docs/what-is-nodecg) on how to install that. I also suggest installing `nodecg-cli`; information on that is also on the documentation just linked.

* `nodecg install hoXyy/mwtourney-layout` to install the latest version of these layouts.
